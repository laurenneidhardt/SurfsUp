# SurfsUp
## Overview of the Analysis ##
The purpose of this analysis is to examine weather pattern in Hawaii in the months of June and December, to evaluate the opening of a surf shop. The hope with this data is to glean some insight as to how the weather might effect the business, possibly helping or hindering. 
## Results ##
The results of June's temperature patterns:

The results of Decembers's temperature patterns:

Key results from these two sets of data:
1. The average temperature is only about 3 degrees different, so not a very big difference at all.
2. The minimum temperature showed the greatest variance at about 8 degrees, so again not an overwhelming difference. 
3. The maximum temperatures only varied by 2 degrees, so this really shows us the the weather temperature wise is very similar. 




## Summary ##
In short, the data doesn't show a huge difference temperature wise. Two additional queries I would perform would be to include rainfall amounts in both months, as that can likely hinder profits and I would look at the stations that are geographically closer to the proposed shop location. Maybe then some greater differences in the months would become apparent.
